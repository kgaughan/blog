Ideas
=====

You might be reading this and wondering 'why is Keith publishing his post ideas
out in the open like this?' Well, it really doesn't matter, to be honest: the
whole repo is out in the open, so if I had some drafts I was working on, you'd
see them anyway.

* On language learning: should cover what I do, where I am, and what I need to
  do.

* Basic linguistics for language learners: some kind of introduction the
  grammar and syntax to help somebody who's learning a language, especially one
  very different from the one they already know. Would likely be a series.

* On procrastination: vent about my bad habits.

* The problem with stuff: vent about having too much 'stuff' and not being able
  to force myself to get rid of it.
