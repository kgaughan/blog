This is the [Pelican][] source for [my blog][]. I can't see there being
anything terribly interesting here except maybe to poke around some unpublished
draft posts that might be checked in.

I use [uv][] for my tooling these days. That must be installed for anything
else to work.

The makefile should be portable, so it'll work with both GNU make and BSD make.
