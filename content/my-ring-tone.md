I wrote this ages ago, but I want to post it somewhere so I won't lose it if my phone dies or something. And vanity, of course.

**Model:** Nokia 3310 **Tempo:** 180BPM

4c2 4d2 2e2 4e2
2g2 4g2 1f2
```

Note: I ought to change the note lengths because this _really_ should use a lower beat rate.

It's an abbreviated version of the whole tune, which is why there's that slightly dodgy transition--which, I'm thankful, nobody notices--in the middle.
