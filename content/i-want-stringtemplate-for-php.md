Ever since reading Terence Parr's [Enforcing Strict Model-View Separation in Template Engines](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/papers/mvc.templates.pdf) (PDF), I've wanted something like [StringTemplate](https://stringtemplate.org/) for PHP.

Maybe not something exactly the same, but a templating system that would perform similarly as far as the person developing the templates would be concerned, but the coder populating the templates would instead be talking to a class generated from the template itself. In essence, a StringTemplate compiler for PHP.

But is there anything like that? Unfortunately, no. It'd almost drive a man to write something like it...
