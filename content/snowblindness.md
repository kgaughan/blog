...or why it's sometimes a good idea to just completely walk away.

I've been working on something here at work that really, _really_ ought to have been done a good long time back. But between this and that, being pulled hither and thither, and having lots of _other_ stuff to do at the same time, I could never get this particular task finished.

The thing is, the task itself is important, _very_ important. However, because it's so important, it became impossible to do even the slightest things on it without screwing it up. I was [snowblind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_blindness).

So this weekend, rather than going anywhere near a computer, I did the very opposite: aside from starting an update on my laptop, I left computers and computer programming completely and [did something completely different](https://web.archive.org/web/20081122004815/http://www.myspace.com/richiejape).

The gig itself was yesterday in Electric Avenue in Waterford, and it was awesome. Seeing as it was on pretty late, and I'm working today, I didn't bother sleeping and just rode the bus back to Carlow.

Sure, I'm tired, but my head was clear. I started back on the project and it was immediately clear what the problem was, and it was so terribly simple to fix.

And that's the thing about snowblindness: sometimes it's good idea to just completely walk away.
