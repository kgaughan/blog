Sales are great. I picked up a copy of [China Miéville](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/china-mi%C3%A9ville/f610ad53-0f0c-4f77-a07f-08d5dcddecdf)'s [The Scar](http://www.sfreviews.net/scar.html) in Hardback for next to nothing!

Also, Waterstones finally managed to source a copy of [Describing Morphosyntax](https://web.archive.org/web/20081012080022/http://www.langmaker.com/db/bks_describingmorphosynta.htm) for me. I placed an order for it two months ago, and it only came on Friday. This is the conlanger's bible, a field linguist's manual, and at €31.65, not cheap. But it rocks!
