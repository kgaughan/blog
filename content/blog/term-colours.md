It&#8217;s been seven years since I&#8217;ve had a set of terminal colours that
I&#8217;ve liked, but I think I&#8217;ve finally worked out the colour scheme I
used to have back then. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using now:</p>

| Palette element | Colour  | Description                         |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Text            | #A4CC28 | Lime                                |
| Background      | #283328 | Sea green                           |
| Black 1         | #000000 |                                     |
| Black 2         | #555555 |                                     |
| Red 1           | #AA0000 | Slightly desaturated crimson        |
| Red 2           | #FF5555 | Erm, pink...                        |
| Green 1         | #555555 |                                     |
| Green 2         | #62C462 |                                     |
| Yellow 1        | #BF6000 | Orange brown                        |
| Yellow 2        | #FFBF00 | Orange yellow                       |
| Blue 1          | #005FBF | Dark sky blue                       |
| Blue 2          | #9BAEC2 | Light sky blue, with a dash of grey |
| Magenta 1       | #AA00AA |                                     |
| Magenta 2       | #FF55FF |                                     |
| Cyan 1          | #008080 |                                     |
| Cyan 2          | #66CCCC |                                     |
| White 1         | #808080 |                                     |
| White 2         | #FFFFFF |                                     |

Here's what it looks like. The screen shot is of Vim with the koehler colour scheme running in a terminal displaying some of the templating code in AFK:
