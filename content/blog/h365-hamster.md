Not that this has anything to do with the [power supply problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062852/http://hosting365status.com/2007/06/15/power-issues-15th-june-1035am/) a [certain Irish hosting company](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062852/http://www.hosting365.com/) had recently or anything... 

With kudos to Podge for the idea.

**Update:** Hmmm... it appears the post on H365's blog has [mysteriously vanished](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062852/http://ellybabes.jaiku.com/presence/14270069). Oh well, [here's Google's cache of it](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062852/http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:BUN7lRc-ecEJ:hosting365status.com/2007/06/15/power-issues-15th-june-1035am+http://hosting365status.com/2007/06/15/power-issues-15th-june-1035am/), and I might grab a copy before it disappears. Oh, and 'Rahood' posted [this from archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20070617142732/http://hosting365status.com/) on [Michele's blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828062852/http://www.mneylon.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/revisionism-web-20-style/), so I think it's worth mentioning here.
