Earlier this summer, I started brushing up on my French, and learning Spanish and Portuguese using [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). More recently, I started learning some Dutch too for when I attend FOSDEM. Here are some resources I'm using to help me.

## General

* [Forvo](http://www.forvo.com/): for getting the proper pronunciation of words.
* [Linguee](http://www.linguee.com/): good for figuring out the context in which words are used.
* [Reverso dictionary](http://dictionary.reverso.net/).
* [Tatoeba](http://tatoeba.org/): a database of example sentences translated into different languages.
* [Verbix](http://www.verbix.com/): verb conjugations.
* [Study aids](http://duolingo.wikia.com/wiki/Study_aids).
* [FSI language courses](http://www.fsi-language-courses.org/): dated, but free and comprehensive.

## Dutch

* [DutchGrammar.com](http://www.dutchgrammar.com/).

## French

* [ebooks libres et gratuits](http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/): Free e-books in French.
* [Practice French verbs](http://practicefrenchverbs.com/).
* [Larousse](http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais).

## Portuguese

* [Conjuga-me](http://www.conjuga-me.net/): Portuguese verb conjugations.
* [Practice Portuguese](http://www.practiceportuguese.com/): I'm learning Brazilian Portuguese, but I just found this, and I figure it's a good idea to at least become familiar with European Portuguese.
