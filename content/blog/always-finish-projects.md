I was looking at my feeds earlier, and peeking through Simon Willison's weblog feed, and spotted [a reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828101517/http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/09/14/liveBookmarks) to [Live Bookmarks](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828101517/http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/live-bookmarks.html) in it. Go take a look at the [screenshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828101517/http://www.mozilla.org/images/lb-screen.gif): it looks frighteningly similar to a cross between Sage and a cut-down version of [what I described for Mocha]({filename}i-love-sage.md) earlier.

This is why you should always try to follow through with the interesting ideas you come up with, because sooner or later somebody will come up with it do.

That's it: I _have_ to start working on it again.
