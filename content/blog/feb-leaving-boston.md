I've to check out of the hotel at 12pm. My flight's just after 7pm. I _might_ be meeting up with [Mark](http://www.zompist.com/) later, which would help kill a lot of time. Of course, that's all moot unless I can check in early.

Good news is I managed to get down to Barnes & Noble and pick up copies of [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html), [Programming Ruby](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/), and [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/). Bad news is that it looks as if I'm not going to be able to pick up the pin my mother asked me to get as a souvenir, nor am I able to get that packet of Oreos (because they apparently taste better in the US) and Reese's Peanut Butter Cup for Brietta. Oh well, I'll be back in about three or four weeks, so I'll do it then.

Snow-wise, things are looking good. There's only a few centimetres of the white stuff and with any lucks that's the way things will stay. Worst comes to worst, I'll be stuck waiting in the airport an extra hour or so.

Must take photos.
