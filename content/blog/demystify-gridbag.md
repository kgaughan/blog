This is an excellent explaination about what must be one of the most puzzling parts of [AWT](https://web.archive.org/web/20081011170136/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html)/[Swing](https://web.archive.org/web/20081011170136/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/overview-summary.html) development: the [GridBagLayout](https://web.archive.org/web/20081011170136/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/GridBagLayout.html) layout manager.

The original was an MS Word file. I converted it to LaTeX for my own use, but I think others might find it useful too. I redid the the diagrams to make them clearer, and reworded the text ever-so-slightly because I was, ahem, too lazy to use crossreferences. Enjoy!

If Peter or anybody from IBM would like me to take this down, I'll do so as soon as possible after I'm contacted.
