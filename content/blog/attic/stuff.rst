Stuff

I have stuff. Or rather, stuff has me.

It's funny how what was once 'your stuff' can begin to own *you* itself.

It starts off small: you move into a place with just the stuff you need, and as
you live there, you accumulate more and more stuff. As time moves on, you stop
owning it, and it starts to feel as if it owns you.

It can be difficult to get rid of stuff: with some stuff, it has memories
attached to it, and with other stuff, it seems somehow wasteful to get rid of
it.

For instance, I have a big pile of accumulated magazines, closing in on a metre
high, which has accumulated over the years. I don't know why, but I can't bring
myself to throw them out. It seems wasteful to throw them out, so maybe I
should sell them off to somebody who'd use them. Bringing myself to get rid of
them is hard.

I also have clothes accumulated over time due to gifts, conference swag, and my
once-expanding waistline. Some of it is stuff that doesn't fit me anymore, some
of it is stuff that stopped fitting and now fits (or almost fits) again, and
some of it... I'm not sure if I've ever even worn. I ought to bring as much of
this to a charity shop as I can, but doing so is... hard.

Then there are the various electronic gadgets and cables that accumulate over
time.
