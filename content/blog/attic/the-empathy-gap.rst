.. So, what's this post going to be about?

   This is a problem:
   http://www.independent.ie/world-news/north-america/us-election-2016/will-there-be-a-pence-plaza-us-vicepresident-elect-could-be-visiting-ireland-35202875.html

   Apparently, Mike Pence's grandfather is from Doocastle.

   This is also a problem:

       "We will be writing to him officially to invite him to the home of his
       ancestors. Regardless of policies he is still an ex-Tubbercurry man as
       far as we are concerned."

   How do you make an argument against that without seeming like someone out
   of touch with the concerns of the local area?

   Stuff to go over:

   Other things:

   * Assume most people are fundamentally good, but approaching the world with
     different frames.

   * Consider bad actors using this for manipulative purposes.

   * Make it clear that this is currently just some intellectual noodling to
     help me properly formulate my own thinking on the subject.

   * Maybe write a blog post on formulating a morality on axiomatic grounds:
     a code of morality must be based on some necessarily subjective axiomatic
     basis, but should flow objectively from those axioms. This isn't so much
     about creating an intellectually rigorous moral code so much as knowing
     what your founding assumptions are, while keeping in mind that any attempt
     to be perfectly consistent is doomed to failure.
