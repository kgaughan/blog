[Clashes in Dublin over loyalist march](http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0225/loyalist.html).

It's time for some righteous anger and disgust from me over what's been happening back home. However utterly wrongheaded and pointless I think the "Love Ulster" march was, I'd no problem with it going ahead. However, the last thing anybody with a brain in their head would have wanted is the violence that erupted due to the clashes between republicans and the GardaÃ­. Sure, the march might have been rather provocative, but the manner in which the counterprotest took place did _nothing_ to promote the republican cause. **Nothing**. Get that into your thick heads. All it's done is portray the Republic, a country I'm proud to be a citizen of, to be as backward and sectarian as Northern Ireland, which I know it's not.

As far as I'm concerned, everybody involved in this, both loyalist and republican, can bugger off back to that hellhole up north they call home. Nobody wants any of you here. You're a boil on our collective arses and want _nothing_ to do with any of you. Come back when you're willing to join the rest of Ireland and the UK in the twenty-first century.

And that goes for the [Republican Sinn Fein](http://www.rsf.ie/) gobshites from the Republic who were involved in this: grow up, assholes. You're never going to turn us into the twisted, dysfunctional state you want us to be. We've moved on since partition. **You do not represent me nor anybody else in the Republic.** Go read the [Easter Proclaimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Proclamation):

> The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

You people claim to support that, but you've done nothing but spit on those ideals.

**Update:** It appears [Charlie Bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Bird) was the [journalist injured during the riots](http://www.sluggerotoole.com/index.php/weblog/rte_reporter_attacked_and_called_orange_bastard/). Apparently, those attacking him called him an "orange bastard", which shows they were probably RSF supporters from the North, because he's one of the most recognisable people in the country, and you'd need to be from abroad _not_ to recognise him.
