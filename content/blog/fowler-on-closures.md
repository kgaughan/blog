Martin Fowler's [talking about closures](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Lambda.html) on his blog. I was rather disappointed that he didn't bring up JavaScript when he was talking about it.

Why do I mention it, besides the fact that [I like JS](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaScriptRocks) as a language? It's because it's given far less credit than it deserves: JavaScript more than any language is the one that has done the most to popularise and spread [closures](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LexicalClosure) as a concept. As [Eric Lippert noted](https://web.archive.org/web/20080620014006/http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/EricLi/PermaLink.aspx/17d9d5ed-402e-4174-98ab-a2690976756a), "Waldemar Horwat--who was at one time the lead Javascript developer at AOL-Time-Warner-Netscape--once told me that he considered Javascript to be just another syntax for Common Lisp. I'm pretty sure he was being serious; Waldemar's a hard core language guy and a heck of a square dancer to boot."

[Closures](https://jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html) are what allow OOP in JS, and prototype-based OO like that of Dylan and JS is without a doubt far more powerful and flexible than class-based OO. Ah, the terrible lightness of being misunderstood.

* [Echewing prototypes in favour of classes seems wrong, even counterproductive, to me, but this guy thinks it's a good idea](https://web.archive.org/web/20080620014006/http://www.theopensourcery.com/osrevJStrends.htm). What's even worse is that he seems to think uninferred types are a good thing, though maybe I'm misreading him.
