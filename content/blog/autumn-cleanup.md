I've started on a bit of a cleanup of various distractions in my life. I'm also looking to see what I can wind down that I currently run.

I've deleted and blocked YouTube for a start. It's became nothing but a timesink and I'm not sure the benefits outweigh the costs anymore.

I've archived most of [my Github projects](https://github.com/kgaughan). It was almost entirely half-finished projects and stuff I was probably never going to maintain anyway. A few are essentially functionally complete such as [stowage](https://github.com/kgaughan/stowage), [nxtp](https://github.com/kgaughan/nxtp), and [socketmap-sql](https://github.com/kgaughan/socketmap-sql). I'll maintain [komorebi](https://github.com/kgaughan/komorebi) for a while longer, but I'm strongly considering archiving it as I'm considering turning [Inklings](https://talideon.com/inklings/) into a static site. I'm going to continue maintaining [mercury](https://github.com/kgaughan/mercury) for now as there's still some functionality I want to add, but as I don't think anyone uses it and the project I wrote it for no longer is, I'm strongly considering archiving it at some point. That leaves my [improved gcredstash fork](https://github.com/kgaughan/gcredstash), which only really existed to make my life at work a bit easier. Again, I don't think anyone really uses it, so I have very little reason to continue maintaining it.

I'm strongly considering moving away from self hosting. That means finding a mail provider so I can offload things there and moving what websites I have to some kind of static hosting, and if I do so, that means that Inklings will go static too, or be replaced with an extremely simple renderer. I barely post anymore. I'm not sure what I'll do about that yet, and I'll need to rethink my DNS hosting. I self-host [tt-rss](https://tt-rss.org/), but if I'm to be honest with myself, I barely read a fraction of the feeds I'm subscribed to these days.

That's a start, at least. I'm eying things around my flat, such as books, to figure out what I actually need and what's just a waste of money that's taking up space. There's a lot of it, but I don't think much of it is any good to anyone else. Maybe I'll find a home for some of it.
