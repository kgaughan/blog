Title: KWiki becomes FusionWiki

I'm changing the name of my ColdFusion-based wiki engine to _FusionWiki_. Why? I want to put it up on SourceForge, and _KWiki_ was already taken. And it's a cool name.

I applied to have the project created just today, so it might take a while before they get back to me on whether or not they're willing to host the CVS repository. But I'm optimistic, and have installed [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) on my machine here at work so I can work on it when I've time.

And on the topic of this site, you might notice that while the listing order of entries on the front page is still date-descending, it's now date-_ascending_ in the archives. I thought that might feel a bit more natural.

**Update**: It was approved! The project homepage is: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fusionwiki/
