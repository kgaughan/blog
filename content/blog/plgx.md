My sleep patterns are really screwed up.

I ended drifting off to sleep at 9pm last night, and woke around 3.30am. In an effort to send myself back to sleep, I knocked out [PLGX](https://github.com/kgaughan/random-hacks/tree/master/plgx), a small DHTML-based presentation system for those of us who neither want nor need PowerPoint. It's been tested Firefox 1.5 and Opera 8, and works fine in each. IE6, on the other hand, I quickly gave up on because it didn't seem to support using _onkeypress_ on the _window_ object to capture cursor key presses. Ah well, I'm not too bothered.
