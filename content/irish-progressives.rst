The progressive in Irish

It's funny. When I started this, I didn't think the first proper post here I'd
make would be on Irish grammar. This assumes a certain basic knowledge of
Irish, such as word order and basic vocabulary. `Tweet at me`__ with any

Like English, but unlike many other European languages, Irish and English both
make a very sharp distinction between the simple indicative ('I do something')
vs the progressive indicative ('I am doing something'). However, Irish makes
some further distinctions that English lumps into the progressive which can
seem a bit weird to an English speaker, the most important being
*state-of-being*.

To show the difference, we'll take the verbs `siúil`_ meaning 'walk' and
`codail`_, meaning 'sleep', whose verbal nouns are 'siúl' and 'codladh'
respectively. In English, we'd say 'She is walking' or 'He is sleeping' for
each of these, but in Irish, we make a distinction due to the nature of these
action. In the case of walking, it's something you continuously actively do,
whereas in the case of sleeping, it's a state you're in for an extended period
of time, so it's not really the same kind of progressive action being
performed.

In the first case, the simple progressive is used. This is formed with the
preposition ag_ followed by a verbal noun. So, in the case of 'she is walking',
you'd say 'Tá sí ag siúl'. However, you can't say 'Tá sé ag codladh', as this
would imply the person is actively, consciously sleeping. Instead, a different
construction is used to denote a progressive state-of-being: 'Tá sé ina
chodladh', which literally translates as 'he is in his sleeping'.

This state-of-being progressive is formed from the preposition i_ (meaning
'in'), followed by a possessive pronoun agreeing with the subject, and the the
verbal noun.

If you were to use this state-of-being progressive with a verb that typically
takes the simple progressive, it would imply that the person wasn't actively,
consciously performing the action. So if somebody were to say 'Táim i mo
shiúl', it would almost imply that they were walking around like a zombie!

Most of the time it's obvious which progressive should be used under which
circumstances, and which verbs it would be odd to use a particular progressive
form with. There are some oddballs, however, such as rith_ (meaning 'run'),
which, in spite of *intuitively* being a verb you'd use with the simple
progressive [*]_, is actually
used with the state-of-being progressive. Thus, if you wanted to say 'I am
running' rather than saying 'Táim ag rith', you'd say 'Táim i mo rith'.

Some verbs are rarely used in the simple indicative form, and are instead
always progressive because they indicate some long-lasting state. The verb
`cónaigh`_ (meaning 'live, reside, rest') is one of these. If you wanted to say
'I live in Carlow', you wouldn't say 'Cónaím i gCeatharlach', but instead 'Táim
i mo chónaí i gCeartharlach'. This is because residing somewhere is a state you
are in, not something that happens in an instant.
