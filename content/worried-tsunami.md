Right now I'm worried. I haven't posted up anything since it happened because I didn't know what to write, but I'm worried about Thérèse and Vinnie, two friends of mine who are travelling through SE Asia right now.

I haven't heard word from them in ages, but then again I haven't been able to check my eircom.net email address. So what I'm basically asking is that if either of ye read this and want to assure me that ye're ok, leave a comment here.

Meanwhile the rest of ye should at least try and do something small by contributing to one of the [Irish Red Cross](http://www.redcross.ie/help/donate_now.php), [Concern](http://concern.ie/), [Trócaire](http://trocaire.org/), or [UNICEF](http://www.unicef.ie/).

**Update:** I'm after downloading all 550 or so emails since the 23rd, and not a thing from them.

**Update Two:** All is well! Thérèse is after sending everybody a "Happy New Year" email. Phew! Stupid me!
