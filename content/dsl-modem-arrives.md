I received the [DSL modem](https://web.archive.org/web/20081011165910/http://www.zyxel.com/product/model.php?indexcate=1107513255&indexcate1=1021877946) earlier today. I'm just testing it out right now. It's sooooo fast! This rocks!

One annoyance though: I ordered a [DSL modem with a wireless hub built in](https://web.archive.org/web/20081011165910/http://www.zyxel.com/product/model.php?indexcate=1079416368&indexcate1=1021877946) so that I could work in peace and quiet and not have to sit in our (big and cold) living room all day. But no wireless. Hmmm... I'll have to do something about that.

**Update:** They sent me out the wireless hub and lots of apologies. Double hurrays!
