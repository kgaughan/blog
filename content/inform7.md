Now, here's something worth blogging about! I'd been wondering why there was no activity on Inform for years.

[Graham Nelson](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828063128/http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/) has just released Inform 7. Now, this is no incremental release, it's a _revolutionary_ release!

Inform is a system for developing [interactive fiction](http://www.ifarchive.org/) (or _adventure games_, as they were once called) that targetted [Infocom](http://www.infocom-if.org/)'s [Z-machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) virtual machine. [Inform 6](http://www.inform-fiction.org/inform6.html) was a great language for developing interactive fiction, and the Z-machine was versatile enough to produce [some](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828063128/http://baf.wurb.com/if/game/920) [surprising](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828063128/http://baf.wurb.com/if/game/94) [results](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828063128/http://baf.wurb.com/if/game/128).

It also had an excellent natural language parser.

But now, after three years of work, you don't need to be able to program to develop IF with Inform: [Inform 7 was announced yesterday on rec.arts.int-fiction](http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/browse_thread/thread/f5919cf1b49badac/17791dfefeec46e0#17791dfefeec46e0) and now understands natural language (and compiles that to Inform 6 code), and has an IDE to make it simple for non-programmers--writers--to develop IF. What can't be easily modelled in English can be described graphically.

I haven't had time to give the [documentation](http://inform7.com/doc/) a proper read-through, but what I've see is pretty incredible! Go take a look.
