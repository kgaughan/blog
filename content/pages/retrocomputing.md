For anyone coming to this site, this is written with the assumption that you're based in Europe, and the EU in particular, as I live in Ireland.

## C64

### Replacement and expansion hardware

* A good source of replacement C64 PSUs looks to be [c64psu.com](https://c64psu.com/), who are based in Poland. They also do Amiga, C128, and combo PSUs.
* [The Future was 8-bit](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/) the [Kung Fu Flash](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/shop/commodore/kung-fu-flash.html) cart, as well as diagnostic and dead test carts. I think they're based in the UK, but they look to be OK for EU shipments at least as far as tax goes. Might still be some customs surprises.
