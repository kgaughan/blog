Once upon a time, I was a relatively active [conlanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), and was active in the conculture community, particularly the [Ill Bethisad](http://ib.frath.net/w/Ill_Bethisad) shared universe, and had some of my own.

I'd like to get back into all that, and I'm currently working on resurrecting all my old work. I've a lot to dig out, and I'm not doing it in any particular order.

## Concultures and conlangs

* [The Ananagyu]({filename}ananagyu.md) and their language a-Illiyar.
* [Sketchlangs]({filename}sketchlangs.md).
