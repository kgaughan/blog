Title: Tèrnaru

Consider this an attempt to remake my old Tèrnaru language from scratch.

## Overview

The language is primarily isolating, and has a SOV typology, though it
displays remnants of an ancestor language with VSO typology,
particularly in the initial complex, which is a fossilised auxiliary
verb. Its morphosyntactic alignment resembles that found in Austronesian
alignment, but also resembles that of fluid-S languages.

## Phonology

The transcription method used in this document is *not* the language’s
native orthography and is only a latinisation for convenience.

The phonology of the language is relatively simple.

### Vowel system

There are nine vowels. The schwa only occurs in unstressed syllables.

```text
i       u
 e  ə  o
  ɛ   ɔ
   a ɑ
```

Orthographically, these are realised as:

```text
i       u
 e  y  o
  è   ò
   a á
```

‘y’ might appear to be an odd choice to represent schwa, but I’m Irish
and I’m familiar with Welsh and Manx, so it’s not odd to me. The choice
of the grave accent for lowering and thus ‘è’ and ‘ò’ to represent /ɛ/
and /ɔ/ is based on Romance languages. My choice of ‘á’ to represent /ɑ/
is based loosely Irish and the fact that I needed some reasonable choice
to represent the sound and recycling the grave accent didn’t seem
appropriate. Other possibilities would’ve been to use the trema or the
circumflex, but both would’ve had their own issues.

### Consonants

The consonant system is similarly simple:

```text
           Bil    Alv  Ret  Vel
           U  V   U V    V  U V 
Stop       p  b   t d       k g
Fricative  f  v   s z
Nasal         m          n
Flap                          r
Lat. App.                l
```

/f/ can be realised as either [f] or [ɸ] and /v/ as [v] or [β].
They’re generally realised bilabially. /s/ can be realised [ʃ] or
[s] and /z/ and be realised as [ʒ] or [z]. Both are generally
realised as alveolar consonants. [h] is occasionally used to prevent
hiatus, but is not written.

### Phonotatics

To do.

## Some sample sentences

```text
?       fè  ták
?       βe  tɑk
MID.PST 1sg hit
'I hit myself'
```
