This site was built with the [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) static site builder.

It uses the [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) library for rendering human-friendly times.

It uses a fork of the [pelican-page-hierarchy](https://github.com/akhayyat/pelican-page-hierarchy/) plugin to organise the non-blog pages on the site, and the [readtime](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/readtime) plugin. Unfortunately, both of these plugin are unmaintained and I haven't been able to find an alternative to them. It'd be nice if something did the work of both Pelican and Mkdocs, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything like that in the Python ecosystem.

It uses a number of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) SVG icons:

* Feed
* LinkedIn
* Stack Overflow
* Github
* Mastodon

The server on which this site is hosted is running [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), and it's hosted at [Blacknight Solutions](https://www.blacknight.com/), who are good people.

The theme is called _Fire and Ice_, and is my own work, but I used [pelican-svbtle](https://github.com/wting/pelican-svbtle), which was the theme I originally used on the site, to help figure out the structure. It's not currently in a state where somebody else could use it, unfortunately.
