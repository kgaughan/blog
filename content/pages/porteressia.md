You're mainly going to find stuff on Eretas here for the moment. I'm not confident enough to put anything on the Porteressia themselves online yet.

Well, no more diereses to worry about. I've coopted the letter 'j' to do palatalisation of clusters.

I've started making a lot of changes to Eretas. I'm also designing a set of TeX macros to let me typeset conlangs effectively.

I've slapped the latest collected notes on [Eretas]({attach}../attachments/eretas/eretas.pdf) here, so download, read, and have fun.
