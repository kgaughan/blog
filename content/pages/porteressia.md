![The word 'eretas' in its native script]({static}../images/eretas_e1.png){: align="right" }
The Porteressia (meaning, 'The People of Portu') was a [conculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_culture) I worked on some years back. It's far from finished, but I figure I ought to put my notes up online.

The language and culture were developed for a set of stories I'd intended to write revolving initially about a messiah-like figure called _Portu_ and later on the effect he had on the culture he was part of. The stories were intended to be part of a metaseries centring on something called _The Weave_, and was meant to deal with themes like the resolution of the ideas of pre-destination and free will, the heroism of small actions, and other such lofty things.

I got as far as developing a complete [writing system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system) called _Fenaï[^dieresis]_, a [featural alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featural_alphabet) (albeit with some [abjad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad)-like properties), and one (decorative) typeface. I've included a same of the word 'Eretas', which means 'speech' or 'language', to give you an idea of what text written in the language would look like. It runs from top to bottom, left-to-right. The character shapes take influence from the Syriac [Nestorian script](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syriac.htm) and the [Manchu alphabet](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/manchu.htm), so much so that the [essentialist explanation](http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/essential.html) I came up with for _Fenaï_ is:

> Fenaïr[^articles] is essentially badly scrawled Nestorian masquerading as Manchu.

Feel free to download [my unfinished notes on Eretas]({attach}attachments/eretas/eretas.pdf) in PDF form. Some day, I'd like to revisit Eretas and the Porteressia when I've time and some inspiration.

For a rough idea of what the language looks like, here's a slightly updated version of the CONLANG t-shirt fragment, which translates as 'Fight language death: invent a language': _Mjulhin eretasséan sjessonde; eretas ellonde_. I'm pretty sure that's out of date though. Here's the interlinear:

```text
Mjulhin  eretasséan      sjessonde;     eretas    ellonde
death    language.GENpl  dispute.IMPpl  language  make.IMPpl
```

[^dieresis]: That dieresis is a hint that 'ai' is not a diphthong, but two separately pronounced vowels.

[^articles]: Articles are enclitic, as in languages such as Danish. The article _ir_ ('that') becomes '-r' and is attached to the end of the word. Thus _fenaï_ means 'strokes' whereas _fenaïr_ means 'the strokes'. Similarly, the singular would be _fene_, 'stroke', and _fener_, 'the stroke'.
