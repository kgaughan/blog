Since last summer, I've been trying my best to lose weight. I started at around 105kg, and I'm currently at about 80kg, with another 10kg to go. I'm happy with that progress: it's in or about where I expected to be by now, and I'm really hoping I'll be able to hit 70kg before summer starts.

I don't think I've been doing anything exceptional in that time, though I have some personal physiological quirks that have meant I've had to do things a little differently from how most people would. Here's what I've been doing.

I am not a dietician, so talk to one. To the best of my knowledge, however, there shoule be nothing here a dietician should object to.

Your body is basically a sack
-----------------------------

Back when I was in college, I stumbled across [The Hacker's Diet](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) online.

The book itself contains lots of good advice, and you do what I did and read that instead of this. Had I taken even a fraction of the advice within it back when I was still in college, I probably would've avoided years of being miserable about my weight and instead found something more productive to be miserable about.

One thing in it stuck with me all these years, and that's its model of the human body. While a admittedly a little simplistic, the idea of the body being essentially a rubber bag is a useful one: what goes in must either come out somehow, or the bag will expand. If you want the bag to shrink, more has to come out than goes in. That essentially means two things have to happen: you have to burn through some of the contents, and you have to essentially consume less than you burn.

Now, *how* you burn though that retained weight and *what* you consume while you're doing it makes things more complicated, but it does boil down the task of weight loss to its essentially: *more has to come out than goes in*.

Tracking weight, not calories
-----------------------------

When I started all this, it quickly became obvious that tracking calories was going to be a wash: unless you're using precisely calibrated pre-made meals, I have no idea how you'd do it sensibly.

However, there is something you can track easily: your weight.

When I started, I was logging my weight anyway because I wanted to know how I was doing, but I found that weight was a much better proxy for my progress than calories were: if I found that my weight had plateaued for an extended period without any activity changes, I would look at what I'd been eating recently and identify the potential high-calorie culprit and either reduce or or remove it. If, after a while, that didn't budge, I'd cut something else or reduce a portion size. We all have plenty of low-hanging fruit, so to speak, in our diets, that can be cut out.

Your current weight doesn't matter; your trend does
----------------------------------------------------

One of the reasons why I tracked my weight from the beginning is that I knew that if I was just looking at my day-to-day weight, it would lie to me. After all, your weigh will naturally fluctuate due to things like having eaten, having a bit of water retention, or any other number of things.

What doesn't lie is your weight trend: if you're even semi-regularly weighing yourself and logging that, you can take a weighted mean over time of your weight to see how you're actually doing. Sometimes it'll go up, sometimes it'll go down, but at least if you're looking at that rather than the fact that today you just happen to be half a kilo heavier than yesterday, you'll see you're still making progress overall and there's nothing to get panicked about.

You'll plateau, but don't worry about it
----------------------------------------

The single most annoying thing I found was that even if I barely changed my routine, my weightloss would be punctuated with plateaus followed by sudden drops.

I haven't investigated the reason for this, but I suspect that the body holds on to certain fat reserves until some tipping point of consistent energy use is reached, and will then start burning through them in preference.

That said, it's still worth looking at your diet and activity levels: whenever I've had an upwards spike followed by a plateau, it's because I've either (a) been abroad and thus I've been less careful diet-wise; (b) been snacking when I shouldn't be; or (c) been less active for one reason or another. All of that is fixable, so don't stress it.

You have to eat better
----------------------

This doesn't mean going on some crazy diet. Don't do that. You're just going to end up harming yourself. What you do have to do is eat sensibly. That mean:

-   Cut out the junk food. Seriously. Just cut it out. It's not doing you any good. Eat some fruit or something instead. If you feel it helps, have something every so often, but not every day, and not too much.
-   No fruit juice. Fruit juice might *seem* healthy, and it's OK in small amounts (like a small glass with your toast at breakfast), but it's essentially fructose water. If you want fruit, eat fruit.
-   Moderate your portions. This was a pain for me, because our dinner lady at work doesn't like to see food go to waste and will practically shovel food onto our plates. Just get as much as you need. *Resist the extra helpings.*
-   If you eat bread, eat loaves with small slices. Consider this a bit of a mental hack. I stopped buying sliced pans and switched to eating soda bread. Now, this isn't because soda bread[ref]*Proper* soda bread, mind. It's a matter of national pride. That means made with the following four ingredients: wholemeal flour, baking soda, buttermilk, and salt. It you're putting yeast, egg, sugar, butter, fruit, or caraway seeds in it, it's not soda bread, it's some kind of cake. If you're just adding fruit, that's its own thing called *spotted dog*. Acceptable shop-bought sodas sometimes contain rapeseed oil and some kind of preservative because they have to, but they shouldn't contain anything else.[/ref] is all that much more healthy, but because the slices are smaller.  Essentially, my brain is having two slices of bread and it's happy.  The fact that those slices are smaller doesn't matter: it had two, and it's happy. This is really just a variation on moderating your portions.
-   Have breakfast or don't have breakfast. It doesn't actually matter. If you need something in the morning, eat it. If you don't, then don't. Contrary to popular believe, breakfast doesn't matter that much.
-   Drink water. I'll make feel more full.
-   Chew your food. If you're inhaling it like I tend to do, you'll end up eating more before you feel full.
-   Avoid temptation: have a snack before you go shopping and don't buy junk while you're there.
-   ...but don't deny yourself either: I like biscuits and one of the ways I avoid buying a big packet of bourbon creams is that when I'm in Tesco, I sometimes buy a bag of the cookies[ref]By which I mean soft, moist, oversized biscuits, not 'cookies' as Americans would understand them, which would be what I'd call biscuits.[/ref] they sell in the bakery. I find it easier for me to limit myself to one or two of these a day than avoiding the constant temptation of biscuits.

All of that sounds hard when taken together, but there's no reason why you can't ease into it over time. Portion moderation and chewing are probably the most important points though.

How I exercise
--------------

This is actually a big problem for me. I needed something I could do consistently that would help with aerobic fitness. The obvious choice there is to either run or jog, but owing to the fact that I have stupidly short Achilles tendons in both my legs, I can't do either for any length of time without ending up in agony.

So what do you do? You walk. A lot.

I started off walking 10,000 steps a day, which was achieveable without any great effort as I already walked everywhere.

Then I decided I'd walk for at least 10,000 steps in one session per day. That was harder, but doable most days. I'd go out at 10pm, and start walking.

After a struggle[ref]Buying overtrousers and a waterproof windbreaker helped. I live in Ireland, after all.[/ref], I managed to start doing that pretty regularly, I bumped that up to 13,000.

Over time, I pushed up the amount of time I would spend out up to 2:30h.  Yup, I spend a good chunk of my waking hours just walking around in three very big circles.

Carlow's ring roads aren't exactly the most exciting places in the world, and as you might imagine, walking around them at night gets very tedious very quickly. What I do to relieve that tedium is practicing on Duolingo[ref]Which can get very exhausting, especially when you're maintaining five different languages (Dutch, Esperanto, Portuguese, French, and Spanish) and working through two more (Norwegian and Irish). I don't expect to actually reach any degree of proper fluency in the majority of them, but it at least gives me something to keep my mind occupied.[/ref], and listening to podcasts, of which I either have too many or too few.

That's what I did, and I did it that way because I had to. If I could spend less of my day on walking, I would, but given my circumstances, I can't.
